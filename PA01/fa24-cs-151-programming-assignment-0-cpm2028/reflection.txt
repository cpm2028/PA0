#Solving the problem of budgeting for a trip was simple.
#The problem that was given to me wasnâ€™t super hard and involved only simple math.
#It was simple programming myself rather than with a partner.
#I already had a background in Python and used that knowledge to make inputs, assign variables, and use if/else statements.
#I relearned how to do if/else statements again and it helped me to tell the user if they could afford to go on the trip, or if they could not.
#Next time I do a project like this I will need to add user inputs immediately rather than waiting until the final project is due to add them.
